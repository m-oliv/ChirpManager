A twitter bot that has ["Create a Simple Twitter Bot with Node.js"](https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-twitter-bot-with-node-js-5b14eb006c08), ["How to make a Twitter Bot with Node.js - Part 2"](https://community.risingstack.com/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-node-js/) and ["Why you should have your own Twitter bot, and how to build one in less than 30 minutes"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/easily-set-up-your-own-twitter-bot-4aeed5e61f7f) as base. This bot aims at working as a simple manager to my twitter account [@moliveiradev](https://twitter.com/moliveiradev).

  - **css/style.css** - contains the CSS needed to make the app look pretty.
  - **js/index.js** - the JavaScript code that gives the app its functionality.
